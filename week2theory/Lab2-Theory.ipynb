If the available home is the current one, we add `b_home`.

Any positive number could do here, since all we want to capture is that more in-group neighbors is better. The `b_out=0` captures the idea that households don't care about having out-group neighbors either way: this does not affect the utility. Another way to think of this is that people are indifferent between having an empty house or an outgroup member as a neighbor (but would rather have an ingroup neighbor!)\n",

    "You can think of the `b_home=.01` as a \"tie-breaking\" rule: household won't move unless they can have more in-group neighbors.
